Here we have our main man, lester. Lester is a goose, albeit a strange crooked goose, but a goose. We family members find it humurous that he lives in the side of the house, in an area named "Lesters Garden Bistro". This project is a serious and sarcastic at the same time. This static site is vanilla HTML and CSS, my favorite. Minimal external resources, Maximal speed. The live pages link is here:
